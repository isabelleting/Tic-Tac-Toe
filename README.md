# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description 

A React Tic Tac Toe game with MIT xPro. 

## How To Run

After loading in a browser window, player X starts first, keep taking turns until one player gets three in a row and wins or it's a tie. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

X starts first in our game so I would add a button that both players can click on to give one X and the other O.
